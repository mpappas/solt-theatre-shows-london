## Decisions & Concessions due to time constraints

Server:

- [x] An interval function calls storeShowsData() method which fetches and writes data into json file.
- [x] An API endpoint that accepts GET Requests responds with shows details that load from file.
- [x] We've used morgan a library that offers server side logging.
- [x] Scripts are perfoming actions in both client and server for practical reason.
- [ ] We haven't added tests.

Client:

- [x] Card and CardList components are handling listing data been fetched by our NodeJS service.
- [x] We've added one more component called SearchBox as an added user experience allowing the user to search by title.
- [x] App container is responsing for keeping the state and pass the props to our function components.
- [x] We've used `tachyons` a library to help us design our interface.
- [x] There is a functionality that adds the correct url (subdomain or failover) to the `Buy Now` button or turns it to `Sold Out`
- [ ] Unfortunately there was no time to implement the conditional formating in the extend to grey out the whole Card component.
